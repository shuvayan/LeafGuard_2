Backend Development (FastAPI) FastAPI Endpoint Setup: Disease Detection: Process plant images and predict diseases using a pre-trained model. Diagnosis Generation: Use the ChatGPT API to generate diagnostic text based on the detected disease. Translation: Convert diagnosis text to the selected language using Google Translate or Azure Translator API. Dockerize FastAPI:Create a Dockerfile to containerize FastAPI, install dependencies, and configure the application. Build and test the Docker image locally. Frontend Development Gradio: Allow users to upload an image and choose a diagnosis language. Use HTTP requests to connect with Gradio endpoints for detection, diagnosis, and translation. Deployment on AWS Backend (FastAPI) Deployment: Deploy the FastAPI Docker container on an AWS EC2 instance. Expose the FastAPI service on port 8000 and ensure security groups allow HTTP/HTTPS traffic. Optional: Use an S3 bucket for storing images if needed for persistent storage. Frontend (Gradio) Deployment: Deploy Streamlit on a separate EC2 instance and connect it to the FastAPI backend. Expose Gradio’s UI on a public IP or domain. CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions) Automated Testing: Use GitHub Actions to set up test workflows to run unit tests for both FastAPI and Gradio code. Docker Image Build and Push: Create workflows to build and push the Docker images to a container registry (e.g., Amazon ECR or Docker Hub). Deployment Workflow: Create a GitHub Actions workflow to deploy to AWS using SSH. Trigger this workflow on successful image build or push. Configure Multilingual Support Translation API Integration: Use the googletrans library or Azure Translator for language support in FastAPI’s /translate_diagnosis endpoint. Allow translations to languages such as Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, etc., and configure this API to return the translated text back to Gradio. Monitoring and Maintenance CloudWatch for Monitoring: Use AWS CloudWatch to track CPU usage, memory, and request latency. Logging: Log application errors and user activities in Gradio and FastAPI for debugging and user experience analysis. Security: Use environment variables for sensitive API keys (ChatGPT and translation APIs) and configure API authentication for FastAPI. Application Architecture:
